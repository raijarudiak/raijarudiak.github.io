    <h3>5 HTML Tags I've Learnt and Their Descriptions</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>h1</strong> is one of the heading tags.</dt>

                <dd>Heading tags range between h1 and h6, with h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest.
                These are used for highlighting important topics, with the most important being the biggest. This is shown above, however
                I used h3.</dd>
        
            <dt><strong>p</strong> is the paragraph tag.</dt>
            
                <dd>This commences the body text (paragraphs). Browsers will create a margin (one line of blank text)
                before and after each p tag.</dd>
            
            <dt><strong>ol</strong> is the ordered list tag.</dt> 
                
            <dd>This will create a list of items in order, numbered. This would be a good tag to use to
                create step-by-step instructions, for example. This list of tag definitions is also an example of this.</dd>
            
            <dt><strong>ul</strong> is the unordered list tag.</dt> 
                
            <dd>This will create a list of items in no specific order, with ticks. This would be a good
                tag to use to list off some of your hobbies, for example. This is demonstrated on the previous page.</dd>
            
            <dt><strong>sup</strong> is the superscript tag.</dt> 
                
                <dd>This will superscript the text, meaning half a character above the normal line and is 
                usually smaller than the normal text. This is a good tag to use when writing the date. For example: 
                October 7<sup>th</sup>.</dd>
