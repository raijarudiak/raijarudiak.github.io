    <article><h3>About Me</h3></article>
    <p>Hi! My name is Raija, I am a libra, and I am turning 22 on October 7<sup>th</sup>. I grew up in Windsor Ontario and just moved here about a 
    month ago. I love it here so far and I have made a few friends already. My favourite colour is orange and my favourite foods are 
    sushi and pasta. I &#10084; carbs! I have a kitty named Mouse who is being fostered right now, but she comes home next week! I'm
    actually allergic to cats but I love them so much so I suck it up.</p>
    <p>I love this program a lot so far, however I am nervous for this course in particular. I am <em>GARBAGE</em> at coding but look! I'm doing it!
    As I mentioned in my discussion board introduction, I took a few coding courses in university but was unsuccessful. I am looking
    forward to (hopefully) having the material stick in my brain and to learn how to code websites! I am trying my best and that's all
    that matters, right?</p>
    <p>I love art which is why I picked this program! Although visual arts is what I'm most used to, I am <em>amazing</em> at picking up the 
    skills of video editing and graphic design. I want to be successful in life, and over the years I learned the lesson that you will not
    succeed doing something you don't enjoy. For me, that was math and french studies when I was in university. I actually enjoy this
    field that I'm now in!</p>
    <p>I hope I managed to figure out how to do this assignment correctly, if not please forive me <abbr title="Laugh Out Loud!">LOL!</abbr> Looking forward to a great
    semester.</p>
    <q>When you're good at something, make that everything.</q>
